## âœ… **Summary of the Code: Automated Chess Bot with Stockfish & Actuators**

This project implements a **real-world automated chess-playing bot** using a Raspberry Pi, the **Stockfish chess engine**, and custom actuator logic. The bot supports both **user input via UCI** and **automated piece movement** using motor controls. Key features include:

### ðŸ”¹ **Components:**

* **`chess` library**: Manages board state and validates moves.
* **`chess.engine` (Stockfish)**: Plays as the AI opponent.
* **GPIO & actuator modules**: Handle hardware interaction like moving pieces or castling via stepper motors.
* **UCI Input**: User provides moves in standard UCI format (e.g., `e2e4`).

### ðŸ”¹ **Code Flow:**

1. **Initialize GPIO Pins & Actuator Logic**
2. **Start Stockfish Engine** with skill level configuration.
3. **User Move (White)**:

   * Validates UCI format and legality.
   * Executes physical movement via actuators.
4. **AI Move (Black)**:

   * Stockfish computes optimal move.
   * Actuators physically move the pieces.
5. **Supports special moves** like castling and knight-specific logic.

## ðŸ§  **Conclusion**

This chess bot project integrates **hardware control with AI decision-making**, demonstrating the seamless combination of **mechanical actuation and deep game logic**. It simulates a fully functional interactive chess-playing robot where a user competes against Stockfish, and both human and AI moves are executed automatically on a physical board. The system is expandable and can integrate sensors or LEDs for full board state awareness.
